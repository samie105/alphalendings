          The MyQuickLoan terms presented above are designed to help you explore
          your options and may not be the actual loan terms you qualify for. We
          will not pull your credit until you complete the loan application and
          click "Submit." You must apply using our loan application to see if
          you qualify for a MyQuickLoan. ‍ Your Annual Percentage Rate (APR),
          daily interest rate, and payment amounts will vary based on your
          actual loan terms, including your loan amount and chosen payment
          schedule. The loan options presented above are based on our maximum
          APR of 490%. ‍ For more information on how simple interest loans work,
